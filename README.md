This repository contains open educational resources (OER) for PSYC/EPSY 567 Personality Assessment. The last major update of content was for the Spring 2025 semester.

## Attribution

I am teaching this course for the first time in Spring 2025. The course, especially the topics covered and assembled readings, derive heavily from the most recent version taught by now-Emeritus Professor James Rounds in Spring 2024. 

## Learning Objectives

Course catalog description: Methods and theory in the quantitative assessment of personality; review of research findings and trends.

This course is structured to follow the open access [APA/AERA/NCME Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014)](https://www.testingstandards.net/open-access-files.html)

If you are looking for an applied/data analysis course, I recommend Dr. Susu Zhang's PSYC 490 Measurement & Test Development Lab and its accompanying ebook, [R Programming for Psychometrics](https://bookdown.org/sz_psyc490/r4psychometics/).

## Course Structure

The seminar will consist of **student-led discussion of readings**. Three or more students will be assigned to lead the discussion each week. However, all students should come to class ready to discuss any or all of the readings. The instructor will also provide overviews of the readings and comments on particularly important issues. Your participation in class discussions is valued, appreciated, and critical to the success of the course. 

**Grades** are based on the total number of points earned by the end of the semester. Points come from weekly activities (up to five points per week for 15 weeks) and a course project (assignments leading up to a research proposal or review paper, totaling up to 30 points). There are potentially 105 points to be earned throughout the semester; the overage is intended to provide flexibility for illness, conference travel, personal priorities, etc.

- A: At or above 90 total points
- B: 80-89.999 total points
- C: 70-79.999 total points
- D: 60-69.999 total points
- F: Below 60 total points
+/- grades are not given in this class.

**Activities** are scaled so that approximately 1.5 hours of effort = 1 point. You can earn up to five points per week from activities. Most weeks, there will be more than five options for activities available; you are welcome to choose-your-own-adventure in terms of which activities you complete. The list of activities available each week is contained as the 'module' for that week. You are expected to at least skim everything early in each week to (1) decide which activities you're going to do and (2) quickly be able to find and digest any particular section of readings that come up in class discussion that week. 

Weekly activities are due by Friday 5 pm that week. Late weekly activities may be submitted by Monday 5 pm for 80% credit.

Each class attended earns 1 activity point; class attendance points can't be made up or submitted late. We will be a small class; for the sake of being able to set expectations in advance, we will coordinate a loose schedule of a few student leaders each week to help keep the conversation going. Our discussions will be generally structured around the readings associated with that week. 

Outside of class, the most common activity will be annotating/virtually discussing journal articles in Perusall; multiple readings will be available for annotation/discussion each week. You're expected to skim all the readings that are Activity options; earn a point by commenting. You can earn up to 1 point per article. Perusall applies automatic scoring based on an algorithm that I define; usually, about 4 quality comments or replies will earn a point. You'll be able to see your progress in your Perusall account.

The next most common activity will be evaluating your chosen test (see the Course Project description below) in terms of the recommendations (identified as Clusters) made by the Standards in each chapter of the text. This consistent reflection on a test  (ideally, having selected one relevant to your research/professional goals) is intended to contribute to the materials you have to work with when assembling your Course Project.

Throughout the semester, you will develop a **Course Project** of a research proposal or a review paper (about 12-15 double-spaced pages) about a specific test. From the beginning of the course, you will identify a test to evaluate against the guidelines presented in the Standards text. In addition to these weekly evaluation activities, the course project includes three major assignments up to and including the final paper:

- Week 9: Draft paper or proposal (10 points)
- Week 12: Peer review of 2 others' drafts (10 points)
- Finals week: Final paper or proposal (10 points)

These larger Course Project assignments are due by Monday 5 pm the next week. Late Course Project assignments lose 10% of their grade per day late.

## Schedule

### Week 1 - January 20
- Introduction (Standards, pp. 1-7)
- Additional resource: [How to Read a Scholarly Article](https://libguides.brown.edu/evaluate/Read).
- Overview of Personality
- Why Study Personality Assessment?

- Pick a test for your Course Project 
	- Choose a test that is relevant to your professional/research interests. 
	- It is going to be easier to work with a test that (1) has been researched and published-on fairly extensively and (2) is open-access or you have access to all of the materials for (not something proprietary that you don't otherwise have access to). 
	- "Personality test" is defined very broadly for the purposes of this project; anything that  evaluates relatively consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors could work. Measures of experiences (like stressful life events) would not be appropriate. Measures of ability may be appropriate, but make sure you have access to test materials. 
	- A non-exhaustive list of measures that would work (I know there's enough research and you can access materials): Big Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2), Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), RIASEC interest inventories, Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR), depression/affect measures (like the PANAS, BDI, or CES-D), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Dweck's GRIT scale. 
	- If you have an idea but aren't sure, or want help coming up with ideas, ask.
